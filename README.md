# Donors Project

A project to control donors and yours donations.

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

```bash
compose install
```

To run the application in development, you can run these commands 

```bash
cd [my-app-name]
composer start
```

Or you can use `docker-compose` to run the app with `docker`, so you can run these commands:
```bash
cd [my-app-name]
docker-compose up -d
```
After that, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
